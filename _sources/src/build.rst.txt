Building FleCSI
===============

FleCSI can be configured to run with different distributed-memory
runtimes, including Legion, and MPI. FleCSI also has support for various
fine-grained, node-level runtimes, including OpenMP, Kokkos, and
the C++17 extensions for parallelism. Full documentation for FleCSI
requires both Sphinx and Doxygen. These configuration options are listed
to convey to the reader that the FleCSI build system has several paths
that can be taken to tailor FleCSI to a given system and architecture.

Requirements & Prerequisites
****************************

The following list of requirements provides a complete set of build
options, but is not necessary for a particular build:

.. note::

  CI listings indicate specific versions used by FleCSI's continuous
  integration tests. If nothing is indicated, there is no specific
  version tested.

* **C++17 compliant compiler** |br|
  At the current time, FleCSI has been tested with GNU, Clang, and Intel
  C++ compilers. |br|
  CI: gcc 8.3.0, clang 8.0.1, icpc 19.0.2

* **MPI** |br|
  If Legion support is enabled, the MPI implementation must have support
  for *MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE*. |br|
  CI: mpich 3.2.1, openmpi 3.1.3

* **Legion** |br|
  We are currently using the most up-to-date version of the master
  branch. |br|
  CI: control_replication branch

* **GASNet** |br|
  GASNet is only required if Legion support is enabled.

* **CMake** |br|
  We currently require CMake version 3.12 or greater.

* **Boost** |br|
  We require *program_options* and *stacktrace*. |br|
  CI: 1.70.0

* **Doxygen** |br|
  Doxygen is only required to build the interface documentation.

* **Sphinx** |br|
  Sphinx is only required to build the web-based documentation. We are
  currently using Sphinx 1.1.0. We also require the Sphinx RTD Theme
  (using version 0.4.2). These can be installed on most Linux systems
  using pip.

* **Python** |br|
  We currently require Python 3.0 or greater.

Spack
*****

The preferred method for installing FleCSI is to use the
`spack <https://github.com/spack/spack>`_ package. Spack is easy to
install and configure:

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone git@github.com:spack/spack.git
  $ source path/to/spack/repository/share/spack/setup-env.sh

Once spack is installed, you can install FleCSI like:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack install flecsi

FleCSI supports several different versions and variants, e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack install flecsi@1.0 +legion +graphviz

For a complete list of versions and variants, type:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack info flecsi

If you are a developer, and would like to install only the dependencies of
FleCSI (assuming that you will build FleCSI from
`source
<http://laristra.github.io/flecsi/src/build.html#getting-the-code_>`_),
you can use spack's *--only* option:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack install --only dependencies flecsi backend=legion +hdf5 ^mpich

If you are developing against a particular branch of FleCSI, you can
capture branch-specific spack dependencies by adding the FleCSI spack
repo:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack repo add path/to/flecsi/spack-repo

This will prepend a spack repository path to your spack configuration,
such that the specific branch of FleCSI can override the normal spack
dependencies to provide whatever features are required for a successful
build.

Getting The Code
****************

Clone the FleCSI git repository, and create an out-of-source build area
(FleCSI prohibits in-source builds):

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/laristra/flecsi.git
  $ cd flecsi
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build

**Note: FleCSI developers, i.e., those who have permission to create
new branches and pull requests, should clone the source code using their
github account and the *git* user:**

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone git@github.com:laristra/flecsi.git
  $ cd flecsi
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build

Build Environment
*****************

FleCSI uses CMake as part of its build system. A convenient mechanism
for identifying directory paths that should be searched by CMake's
*find_package* function is to set the *CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH* environment
variable. If you are using the FleCSI TPLs discussed above, you can set
*CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH* to include the path to your TPL installation
directory and FleCSI will automatically find all of its dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

  $ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/install/directory (bash)

Configuration & Build
*********************

Configuration of FleCSI requires the selection of the backend runtimes
that will be used by the FleCSI programming model abstraction to invoke
tasks and kernels. There are currently two supported distributed-memory
runtimes, a serial runtime, and one supported node-level runtime:

* **Distributed-Memory** |br|
  Legion or MPI

* **Serial [supported thorugh MPI runtime]** |br|
  **The serial build is no longer supported.** Users wishing to emulate
  this build mode should select the MPI runtime and run executables with
  a single-rank.

* **Node-Level** |br|
  OpenMP

Example configuration: **MPI**

.. code-block:: console

  $ cmake -DFLECSI_RUNTIME_MODEL=mpi ..

Example configuration: **MPI + OpenMP**

.. code-block:: console

  $ cmake -DFLECSI_RUNTIME_MODEL=mpi -DENABLE_OPENMP ..

Example configuration: **Legion**

.. code-block:: console

  $ cmake -DFLECSI_RUNTIME_MODEL=legion ..

After configuration is complete, just use *make* to build:

.. code-block:: console

  $ make -j 16

Installation uses the normal *make install*, and will install FleCSI in
the directory specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:

.. code-block:: console

  $ make install

Building the Unit Tests
***********************

To build FleCSI unit test suite, enable the option for the FleCSI
logging utility (flog). **By default, this will also enable the unit
tests.**

.. code-block:: console

  $ cmake .. -DENABLE_FLOG

After building FleCSI, you can run the unit tests like:

.. code-block:: console

  $ make test

Building the Documentation
**************************

FleCSI uses Doxygen for its API reference, and Sphinx for user and
developer documentation.

Doxygen can be installed with most Linux package managers.  To install
Sphinx, you can install pip3, and use it to install *Sphinx*,
*recommonmark*, and *sphinx_rtd_theme*. Your package manager should also
have pip3, e.g., on Ubuntu, you can install all of these requirements
like:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo apt install doxygen
  $ sudo apt install python3-pip
  $ sudo apt install python3-breathe
  $ pip3 install Sphinx
  $ pip3 install recommonmark
  $ pip3 install sphinx_rtd_theme

To enable Doxygen and Sphinx, these options need to be enabled in CMake:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cmake -DENABLE_DOXYGEN=ON -DENABLE_SPHINX=ON ..

Once you have properly configured FleCSI, you can build the
documentation like:

.. code-block:: console

  $ make doxygen
  $ make sphinx

Both of these targets will be built in your build directory under *doc*,
e.g., the main Doxygen index.html page will be located at
*'doc/doxygen/html/index.html'*. Similarly, the Sphinx main index.html
page will be located at *'doc/sphinx/index.html'*. You can open these in
your browser with
*file:///path/to/your/build/directory/doc/doxygen/html/index.html*, and
*file:///path/to/your/build/directory/doc/sphinx/index.html*.
